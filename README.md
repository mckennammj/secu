Secu (pronounced Seck You, from the word Secular) is a hybrid mobile/web app that for the MVP allows for non-profits and PoliSci folks to make score cards for legislators based on their voting history using the roll call votes published on the house and senate websites. An example score card is here http://www.cfequality.org/issues/congressionalscorecard/house-115/ 

Propublica has an open api to call U.S. Congress in JSON format but the data actually published on the .gov form is XML. https://projects.propublica.org/api-docs/congress-api/ and https://www.senate.gov/legislative/votes.htm and https://xml.house.gov/

Currently the project uses Phonegap based on Cordova for the hybrid app development. Framework7 is used for the user interface and Splitview Template. Languages used are Javascript, CSS, HTML5.

The long term goal is a mobile app that regular people can use on voting day to quickly compare the candidates based on their actual voting history in their careers as legislators. Each state and locale have different publishing requirements and standards so grabbing from every legislature will be a project in and of itself. The goal is to get the full voting history of legislators from their starting in local/county/state as they climb the ladder. Organizations can make their own score cards and users can see them in the app so you can put in the app what you are pro or con like prof life or pro choice and rank your interests based on how important they are and then either have a custom score card generated or have the organizations scorecards displayed in order of compatibility with your views. You can publish your own score cards in the app if you want, or share on social media. Push notifications for when legislators vote either for or against your interests as soon as the vote is published on the .gov. Features to contact your legislators on social media or email/phone/snail mail when they vote for or against your interests.
