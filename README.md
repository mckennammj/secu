Secu is a hybrid mobile/web app that for the MVP allows for non-profits and poliSci folks to make score cards for legislators based on their voting history using the roll call votes published on the house and senate websites. Propublica has an open api to call them in JSON format but the actually published on the .gov form is XML. The long term goal is a mobile app that regular people can use on voting day to quickly compare the candidates based on their actual voting history in their careers as legislators from their starting in local/county/state as they climb the ladder. Non-profits can make their own score cards and users can see them in the app so you can put in the app what you are pro or con like prof life or pro choice and rank your interests based on how important they are and then either have a custom score card generated or have the non-profits scorecards displayed in order of compatibility with your views. You can publish your own score cards in the app if you want, or share on social media. Push notifications for when legislators vote either for or against your interests as soon as the vote is published on the .gov. Features to contact your legislators on social media or email/phone/snail mail when they vote for or against your interests.
